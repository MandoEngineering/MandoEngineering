- Hi, I’m @MandoEngineering, I am new to engineering, electronics, and programming but I am trying my best to learn and to work on projects that I enjoy. help is very appreciated
- I’m interested in everything, at least a bit, I am still trying to find my favorite topic so I am looking into a lot of things simultaneously
- I’m currently learning Python and microcontroller things like Arduino.
